# Assignment1

This is the first assignment for Smoothstack. Here, I used four classes to segment the image, another to load the image, and a final to hold the variables. This could have been implemented by a single class with multiple methods, but I split them up to solidify the use of inheritence in the "extends" syntax of Java. As such, the methods themselves are static to eliminate the need for initialization from the classes in this case.
